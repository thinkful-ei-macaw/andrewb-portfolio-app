            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hey, Iâ€™m Andrew.  I am currently a student in the Thinkful Engineering Immersion Program,<br>
                 aspiring to become a Full Stack Software Developer.</p>
            <p>I am currently based in Scottsdale, Arizona having recently moved here from Long Island, New York,<br>
                 where the weather is BY FAR warmer and much more pleasant. Gotta work on the Pizza though ;)</p>
            <p>My ambitions in the tech field are as much based on my desire to help people make complex things simple<br>
                 as well as to have the ability to make a difference and solve problems.  Having worked in the banking industry for years,<br>
                  I recognize that making a difference and effecting change are near impossible.  In software development,<br>
                   just about anything you can imagine is possible.</p>
            <p>Outside of coding, I am passionate about fitness, soccer, dogs, and being outdoors as much as is humanly possible.</p>
